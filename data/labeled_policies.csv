Our services include:You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy,1
For example\, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos\, or see more relevant search results,1
And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all\, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos,1
You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode\, like Chrome Incognito mode\, which helps keep your browsing private from other people who use your device,1
And across our services\, you can adjust your privacy settings to control whether we collect some types of data and how we use it,1
To help explain things as clearly as possible\, we’ve added examples\, explanatory videos\, and definitions for key terms,1
And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy\, you can contact us,1
We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our servicesWe collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak\, to more complex things like which ads you’ll find most useful\, the people who matter most to you online\, or which YouTube videos you might like,1

A process or set of rules followed by a computer in performing problem-solving operations,1
An application data cache is a data repository on a device,1
It can\, for example\, enable a web application to run without an internet connection and improve the performance of the application by enabling faster loading of content,1
Browser web storage enables websites to store data in a browser on a device,1
When used in local storage mode\, it enables data to be stored across sessions,1
This makes data retrievable even after a browser has been closed and reopened,1
One technology that facilitates web storage is HTML 5,1
A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website,1
When you visit the site again\, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser,1
Cookies may store user preferences and other information,2
You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent,2
However\, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies,2
Learn more about how Google uses cookies and how Google uses data\, including cookies\, when you use our partners' sites or apps,2
A device is a computer that can be used to access Google services,1
For example\, desktop computers\, tablets\, smart speakers\, and smartphones are all considered devices,1
You may access some of our services by signing up for a Google Account and providing us with some personal information (typically your name\, email address\, and a password),1
This account information is used to authenticate you when you access Google services and protect your account from unauthorized access by others,1
You can edit or delete your account at any time through your Google Account settings,1
Every device connected to the Internet is assigned a number known as an Internet protocol (IP) address,1
These numbers are usually assigned in geographic blocks,1
An IP address can often be used to identify the location from which a device is connecting to the Internet,1
Learn more about how we use location information,1
This is information that is recorded about users so that it no longer reflects or references an individually-identifiable user,1
This is information that you provide to us which personally identifies you\, such as your name\, email address\, or billing information\, or other data that can be reasonably linked to such information by Google\, such as information we associate with your Google Account,1
A pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking certain activity\, such as views of a website or when an email is opened,1
Pixel tags are often used in combination with cookies,2
A Referrer URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is information transmitted to a destination webpage by a web browser\, typically when you click a link to that page,1
The Referrer URL contains the URL of the last webpage the browser visited,1
This is a particular category of personal information relating to topics such as confidential medical facts\, racial or ethnic origins\, political or religious beliefs\, or sexuality,1
Like most websites\, our servers automatically record the page requests made when you visit our sites,1
These “server logs” typically include your web request\, Internet Protocol address\, browser type\, browser language\, the date and time of your request\, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser,2
A typical log entry for a search for “cars” looks like this:A unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser\, app\, or device,1
Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are\, whether they can be reset by users\, and how they can be accessed,1
Unique identifiers can be used for various purposes\, including security and fraud detection\, syncing services such as your email inbox\, remembering your preferences\, and providing personalized advertising,1
For example\, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language,2
You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent,2
Learn more about how Google uses cookies,2
On other platforms besides browsers\, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device,1
For example\, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices\, and can be managed in your device’s settings,1
Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID)\, such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone,1
For example\, a device’s unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services,1
If you’re signed in to your Google Account and have Web & App Activity turned on\, your activity data on Google sites\, apps\, and services may be saved in your account’s Web & App Activity,1
Some activity may include information about the general area you were in when using the Google service,1
When you search for something using a general area\, your search will use an area of at least 3 sq km\, or expand until the area represents the locations of at least 1\,000 people,1
This helps protect your privacy,1
In some cases\, areas that you have searched from in the past may be used to estimate a relevant location for your search,1
For example\, if you search for coffee shops while in Chelsea\, Google might show results for Chelsea in future searches,1
You can view and control your Web & App Activity at My Activity,1
Websites and apps that integrate Google services like ads and analytics share information with us,1
This information is collected regardless of which browser or browser mode you use,1
For example\, although Incognito mode in Chrome can help keep your browsing private from other people who use your device\, third party sites and apps that integrate our services may still share information with Google when you visit them,1
You can learn more about some of the ways you can control the information that is shared when you visit or interact with sites and apps that use Google services,1
For example\, if you watch videos about baking on YouTube\, you may see more ads that relate to baking as you browse the web,1
We also may use your IP address to determine your approximate location\, so that we can serve you ads for a nearby pizza delivery service if you search for “pizza,1
” Learn more about Google ads and why you may see particular ads,1
For example\, merchants may upload data from their loyalty-card programs so that they can include loyalty information in search or shopping results\, or better understand the performance of their ad campaigns,1
We only provide aggregated reports to advertisers that don’t reveal information about individual people,1
Android devices with Google apps include devices sold by Google or one of our partners and include phones\, cameras\, vehicles\, wearables\, and televisions,1
These devices use Google Play Services and other pre-installed apps that include services like Gmail\, Maps\, your phone’s camera and phone dialer\, text-to-speech conversion\, keyboard input\, and security features,1
Learn more about Google Play Services,1
For example\, when you’re signed in to your Google Account and have the Web & App Activity control enabled\, you can get more relevant search results that are based on your previous searches and activity from other Google services,1
You can learn more here,1
You may also get customized search results even when you’re signed out,1
If you don’t want this level of search customization\, you can search and browse privately or turn off signed-out search personalization,1
Examples of how we use your information to deliver our services include:When we detect spam\, malware\, illegal content (including child sexual abuse and exploitation material)\, and other forms of abuse on our systems in violation of our policies\, we may disable your account or take other appropriate action,1
In certain circumstances\, we may also report the violation to appropriate authorities,1
For example\, we can use information from your devices to help you decide which device you’d like to use to install an app or view a movie you buy from Google Play,1
We also use this information to help protect your account,1
For example\, we analyze how people interact with advertising to improve the performance of our ads,1
For example\, we continuously monitor our systems to look for problems,1
And if we find something wrong with a specific feature\, reviewing activity information collected before the problem started allows us to fix things more quickly,1
If you use Google’s Location services on Android\, we can improve the performance of apps that rely on your location\, like Google Maps,1
If you use Google’s Location services\, your device sends information to Google about its location\, sensors (like accelerometer)\, and nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi access points (like MAC address and signal strength),1
All these things help to determine your location,1
You can use your device settings to enable Google Location services,1
Learn moreLike other technology and communications companies\, Google regularly receives requests from governments and courts around the world to disclose user data,1
Respect for the privacy and security of data you store with Google underpins our approach to complying with these legal requests,1
Our legal team reviews each and every request\, regardless of type\, and we frequently push back when a request appears to be overly broad or doesn’t follow the correct process,1
Learn more in our Transparency Report,1
For example\, we use cookies to analyze how people interact with our services,2
And that analysis can help us build better products,1
For example\, it may help us discover that it’s taking people too long to complete a certain task or that they have trouble finishing steps at all,1
We can then redesign that feature and improve the product for everyone,1
Google Analytics relies on first-party cookies\, which means the cookies are set by the Google Analytics customer,2
Using our systems\, data generated through Google Analytics can be linked by the Google Analytics customer and by Google to third-party cookies that are related to visits to other websites,2
For example\, an advertiser may want to use its Google Analytics data to create more relevant ads\, or to further analyze its traffic,1
Learn moreFor example\, to prevent abuse and increase transparency and accountability over our online content moderation practices\, Google shares data about requests for removal of content from our services with Lumen\, which collects and analyzes these requests to facilitate research to help Internet users understand their rights,1
Learn more,1
There are over 2 million non-Google websites and apps that partner with Google to show ads,1
Learn moreFor example\, if you add a credit card or other payment method to your Google Account\, you can use it to buy things across our services\, like apps in the Play Store,1
We may also ask for other information\, like a business tax ID\, to help process your payment,1
In some cases\, we may also need to verify your identity and may ask you for information to do this,1
We may also use payment information to verify that you meet age requirements\, if\, for example\, you enter an incorrect birthday indicating you’re not old enough to have a Google Account,1
Learn moreYou may also see personalized ads based on information from the advertiser,1
If you shopped on an advertiser's website\, for example\, they can use that visit information to show you ads,1
Learn moreIf you add your phone number to your account\, it can be used for different purposes across Google services\, depending on your settings,1
For example\, your phone number can be used to help you access your account if you forget your password\, help people find and connect with you\, and make the ads you see more relevant to you,1
Learn moreYou might choose to save places to your Google Account that are important to you\, such as your home or your work,1
If you set your home or work addresses\, they can be used to help you do things more easily\, such as getting directions or finding results closer to your home or work\, and for more useful ads,1
You can edit or delete your home or work addresses anytime in your Google Account,1
For example\, information about security threats can help us notify you if we think your account has been compromised (at which point we can help you take steps to protect your account),1
For example\, we may collect information that’s publicly available online or from other public sources to help train Google’s AI models and build products and features like Google Translate\, Gemini Apps\, and Cloud AI capabilities,1
Or\, if your business’s information appears on a website\, we may index and display it on Google services,1
For example\, we use a cookie called ‘lbcs’ that makes it possible for you to open many Google Docs in one browser,1
Blocking this cookie would prevent Google Docs from working as expected,1
Learn moreSome examples of how we use your information to help keep our services safe and reliable include:When showing you personalized ads\, we use topics that we think might be of interest to you based on your activity,1
For example\, you may see ads for things like Cooking and Recipes or Air Travel,1
” We don’t use topics or show personalized ads based on sensitive categories like race\, religion\, sexual orientation\, or health,1
And we require the same from advertisers that use our services,1
Your device may have sensors that can be used to better understand your location and movement,1
For example\, an accelerometer can be used to determine your speed and a gyroscope to figure out your direction of travel,1
Learn more about how we use location information,1
For example\, we operate data centers located around the world to help keep our products continuously available for users,1
Examples of these services include:When lots of people start searching for something\, it can provide useful information about particular trends at that time,1
Google Trends samples Google web searches to estimate the popularity of searches over a certain period of time and shares those results publicly in aggregated terms,1
Learn moreFor example\, you can delete your blog from Blogger or a Google Site you own from Google Sites,1
You can also delete reviews you’ve left on apps\, games\, and other content in the Play Store,1
For example\, we allow YouTube creators and advertisers to work with measurement companies to learn about the audience of their YouTube videos or ads\, using cookies or similar technologies,2
Another example is merchants on our shopping pages\, who use cookies to understand how many different people see their product listings,2
Learn more about these partners and how they use your information,1
Your Chrome browsing history is only saved to your account if you’ve enabled Chrome synchronization with your Google Account,1
Learn moreFor example\, when you type an address in the To\, Cc\, or Bcc field of an email you're composing\, Gmail will suggest addresses based on the people you contact most frequently,1
For example\, we process information about requests to remove content from our services under Google's content removal policies or applicable law to assess the request\, and to ensure transparency\, improve accountability and prevent abuse and fraud in these practices,1
For example\, we process your information to report use statistics to rights holders about how their content was used in our services,1
We may also process your information if people search for your name and we display search results for sites containing publicly available information about you,1
Depending on your available settings\, some examples of how we use the information we collect across our services include:For example\, we collect information about views and interactions with ads so we can provide aggregated reports to advertisers\, like telling them whether we served their ad on a page and whether the ad was likely seen by a viewer,1
We may also measure other interactions\, such as how you move your mouse over an ad or if you interact with the page on which the ad appears,1
For example\, you can choose whether you want Google to save an audio recording to your Google Account when you interact with Google Search\, Assistant\, and Maps,1
When your device detects an audio activation command\, like “Hey Google\,” Google records your voice and audio plus a few seconds before the activation,1
Learn moreThis activity might come from your use of Google services\, like from syncing your account with Chrome or your visits to sites and apps that partner with Google,1
Many websites and apps partner with Google to improve their content and services,1
For example\, a website might use our advertising services (like AdSense) or analytics tools (like Google Analytics)\, or it might embed other content (such as videos from YouTube),1
These services may share information about your activity with Google and\, depending on your account settings and the products in use (for instance\, when a partner uses Google Analytics in conjunction with our advertising services)\, this data may be associated with your personal information,1

Updated March 2\, 2023How Shopify handles your dataIn our mission to make commerce better for everyone at Shopify\, we collect and use information about you\, ourThis Privacy Policy will help you better understand how we collect\, use\, and share your personal information,1
If we change our privacy practices\, we may update this privacy policy,1
If any changes are significant\, we will let you know (for example\, through the Shopify admin or by email),1
Trust is the foundation of the Shopify platform and includes trusting us to do the right thing with your information,1
Three main values guide us as we develop our products and services,1
These values should help you better understand how we think about your information and privacy,1
We carefully analyze what types of information we need to provide our services\, and we try to limit the information we collect to only what we really need,1
Where possible\, we delete or anonymize this information when we no longer need it,1
When building and improving our products\, our engineers work closely with our privacy and security teams to build with privacy in mind,1
In all of this work our guiding principle is that your information belongs to you\, and we aim to only use your information to your benefit,1
If a third party requests your personal information\, we will refuse to share it unless you give us permission or we are legally required,1
When we are legally required to share your personal information\, we will tell you in advance\, unless we are legally forbidden,1
Many of the merchants and partners using Shopify do not have the benefit of a dedicated privacy team\, and it is important to us to help them meet their privacy obligations,1
To do this\, we try to build our products and services so they can easily be used in a privacy-friendly way,1
We also provide detailed FAQs and documentation covering the most important privacy topics\, and respond to privacy-related questions we receive,1
We generally process your information when we need to do so to fulfill a contractual obligation (for example\, to process your subscription payments to use the Shopify platform)\, or where we or someone we work with needs to use your personal information for a reason related to their business (for example\, to provide you with a service),1
Laws in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) and in the United Kingdom (“UK”) call these reasons “legitimate interests,1
” These “legitimate interests” include:We only process personal information for these “legitimate interests” after considering the potential risks to your privacy and balancing any risks with certain measures—for example\, by providing clear transparency into our privacy practices\, offering you control over your personal information where appropriate\, limiting the information we keep\, limiting what we do with your information\, who we send your information to\, how long we keep your information\, or the technical measures we use to protect your information,1
We may also process your personal information where you have provided your consent,1
In particular\, where we cannot rely on an alternative legal basis for processing\, where you direct us to transfer information to a third party\, where we receive your data from a third party is sourced and it already comes with consent or where we are required by law to ask for your consent (including in the context of some of our sales and marketing activities),1
At any time\, you have a right to withdraw your consent by changing your communication choices\, opting out from our communications or by contacting us,1
Depending on whether you are a merchant\, customer\, partner\, user or visitor\, please refer to our supplemental privacy policies\, as relevant\, to understand our purposes for processing\, categories of recipients and legal basis for processing for each type of personal data,1
We believe you should be able to access and control your personal information no matter where you live,1
Depending on how you use Shopify\, you may have the right to request access to\, correct\, amend\, delete\, port to another service provider\, restrict\, or object to certain uses of your personal information,1
We will not charge you more or provide you with a different level of service if you exercise any of these rights,1
Please note that a number of these rights apply only in certain circumstances\, and all of these rights may be limited by law,1
If you buy something from or otherwise provide your information to a Shopify-powered store and wish to exercise these rights over information about your purchase or interaction\, you need to directly contact the merchant you interacted with,1
We are a processor and process information on their behalf,1
We will of course help our merchants to fulfill these requests to the extent required by law\, such as by giving them the tools to do so and by answering their questions,1
If you are a merchant\, partner\, Shop user\, Shopify employee\, website visitor or other individual that Shopify has a direct relationship with\, please submit your data subject request through our online portal,1
Please note that if you send us a request relating to your personal information\, we have to make sure that it is you before we can respond,1
In order to do so\, we may use a third party to collect and verify identification documents,1
Further information about rights available to US residents can be found below under the header “United States Regional Privacy Notice”,1
If you are not happy with our response to a request\, you can contact us to resolve the issue,1
If you are located in the EEA or UK\, you also have the right to lodge a complaint with your local data protection or privacy authority at any time,1
Finally\, because there is no common understanding about what a “Do Not Track” signal is supposed to mean\, we don’t respond to those signals in any particular way,1
We are a Canadian company\, but we work with and process data about individuals across the world,1
To operate our business\, we may send your personal information outside of your state\, province\, or country\, including to the United States,1
This data may be subject to the laws of the countries where we send it,1
We take steps to protect your information when we send your information across borders,1
Depending on whether you are a merchant\, customer\, partner\, user or visitor\, please refer to our supplemental privacy policies\, as relevant,1
If you are located in the EEA\, the UK\, or Switzerland\, your personal information is controlled by our Irish affiliate\, Shopify International Ltd,1
Your information is then sent to other Shopify locations and to service providers who may be located in other regions\, including Canada (where we are based) and the United States,1
When we send your personal information outside of the EEA\, UK or Switzerland\, we do so in accordance with applicable law,1
If you are in the EEA\, the UK\, or Switzerland\, when we send your personal information to Canada it is protected under Canadian law\, which the European Commission has found adequately protects your information,1
If we then send this personal information outside of Canada (for example\, when we send this information to our Subprocessors)\, this information is protected by contractual commitments that are comparable to those provided in the Standard Contractual Clauses,1
Finally\, while we do what we can to protect your information\, we may at times be legally required to disclose your personal information (for example\, if we receive a valid court order),1
For information about how we respond to such orders\, please review our Guidelines for Legal Requests,1
We will retain your personal data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which we have collected it,1
To determine the appropriate retention period\, we consider the amount\, nature and sensitivity of your personal data\, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal data\, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means and the applicable legal requirements,1
We will also retain and use your personal information to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations\, resolve disputes and enforce our policies,1
If you stop using our services or if you delete your account with us\, we will delete your information or store your information in an aggregated and anonymized format,1
Depending on whether you are a merchant\, customer\, partner\, user or visitor\, please refer to our supplemental privacy policies\, as relevant\, for further details on the retention of your personal information,1
One of the ways in which we are able to help merchants using Shopify is by using techniques like “machine learning” (some laws\, including certain EEA and UK laws\, may refer to this as “automated decision-making”) to help us improve our services,1
When we use machine learning\, we either: (1) still have a human being involved in the process (and so are not fully automated); or (2) use machine learning in ways that don’t have legal or similarly significant effects (for example\, reordering how apps might appear when you visit the app store),1
Our teams work tirelessly to protect your information\, and to ensure the security and integrity of our platform,1
We also have independent auditors assess the security of our data storage and systems that process financial information,1
However\, we all know that no method of transmission over the Internet\, and method of electronic storage\, can be 100% secure,1
This means we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your personal information,1
You can find more information about our security measures at /security,1
We use cookies and similar tracking technologies on our website and when providing our services,2
For more information about how we use these technologies\, including a list of other companies that place cookies on our sites\, a list of cookies that we place when we power a merchant’s store\, and an explanation of how you can opt out of certain types of cookies\, please see our Cookie Policy,2
If you would like to ask about\, make a request relating to\, or complain about how we process your personal information\, please contact Shopify Support\, or mail us at one of the addresses below,1
If you would like to submit a legally binding request to demand someone else’s personal information (for example\, if you have a subpoena or court order)\, please review our Guidelines for Legal Requests,1
If you are a merchant\, partner\, Shop user\, Shopify employee\, website visitor or other individual that Shopify has a direct relationship with and you are located in the EEA or UK\, Shopify International Ltd is the controller of your personal data,1
If you buy something from or otherwise provide your information to a Shopify-powered store\, the merchant is your data controller and we are acting as a processor on their behalf,1
If you have questions about how a merchant or store processes your personal information\, you should contact the merchant or visit their privacy policy,1

If there is a match\, Netflix can then choose whether or not to send Netflix marketing to you on that third party service\, and can optimize and better measure the effectiveness of such marketing,1
You can indicate your choices in the “Privacy and data settings” (for the relevant profile) within the “Account” section of our website,1

We\, our Service Providers\, Netflix Marketing Providers\, and Advertising Companies use cookies\, other similar technologies (such as pixel tags)\, and resettable device identifiers for various reasons,2
This section explains the types of technologies used\, what they do\, and your corresponding choices,1
To choose whether or not to receive cookies and similar technologies\, please see the section below “How can I exercise choice regarding these technologies?”Cookies are small data files that are commonly stored on your device when you access websites and online services,2
The text in a cookie contains a string of numbers and letters that may uniquely identify a device and can contain other information as well,1
This allows the web server to recognize your browser each time it connects to that web server,1
We use other technologies such as browser storage and plugins (for example\, HTML5\, IndexedDB\, and WebSQL),1
Like cookies\, these other technologies may store small amounts of data on a device,2
Pixel tags often work in conjunction with cookies,2
In many cases\, declining cookies will impair the effectiveness of pixel tags associated with those cookies,2
If you use a Netflix app (such as the main Netflix app\, or a Netflix game app) on a mobile device\, tablet\, or streaming media device\, we may collect a resettable device identifier from your device,1
Resettable device identifiers can be used like cookies and are found on many mobile devices and tablets (for example\, the “Identifier for Advertisers” on Apple iOS devices and the “Google Advertising ID” on Android devices)\, and certain streaming media devices,2
Like cookies\, resettable device identifiers are used to make online advertising more relevant\, and for analytics and optimization purposes,2
We use these types of technologies for various reasons\, including to provide our service (for example\, by making it easy to access our service by remembering you when you return); to administer and operate our business\, to research\, analyze and improve our services (for example\, to improve site performance\, monitor visitor traffic and actions on our site\, and to test the effectiveness of our user interface); to send marketing and informational messages (for example\, to deliver and tailor our marketing\, and to understand interactions with our emails\, marketing\, and marketing on third party services); to operate our ad supported subscription plan; for safety\, security and fraud prevention; and to comply with law and enforce our Terms of Use,1

We use pixel tags in our emails to understand how members interact with our services,1
Our use of pixel tags helps us understand when links within messages are clicked\, or the emails are opened,1
Netflix uses resettable device identifiers to display marketing for our service or Netflix content on third party services\, and to operate our ad supported subscription plan (including delivering Advertisements to you),1
To learn more about the types of cookies used by Netflix\, please click here,2
To exercise choice regarding cookiesFor more information about cookies set through our service and to exercise choices regarding cookies\, click here,2

If you choose not to allow this\, you may still see marketing messages promoting Netflix (and Advertisements if you subscribe to an ad supported subscription plan) on that device but it will not be selected based on the use of a resettable device identifier,1
Note that your choice regarding the resettable device identifier is specific to that device,1
To exercise choice regarding other similar technologiesIn addition to any choices we may offer you in the Netflix service\, there are several ways to exercise choice regarding technologies that are similar to cookies\, such as browser storage and plugins (for example\, HTML5\, IndexedDB\, and WebSQL),2
For example\, many popular browsers provide the ability to clear browser storage\, typically in the settings or preferences area,1
See your browser's help function or support area to learn more,1
Most email clients have settings that allow you to prevent the automatic downloading of images\, including pixel tags\, and the automatic connection to the web servers that host those images,1
